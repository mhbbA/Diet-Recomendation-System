## Project Overview

Sehha Bites is a personalized food recommendation system that provides users with meal suggestions tailored to both their dietary preferences and specific health needs. Utilizing a rich dataset from KAGGLE, our model takes into account unique user profiles, including chronic health conditions and allergen sensitivities, to make safe and enjoyable food recommendations.

## Key Features

- Health-Aware Recommendations: Customizes food suggestions based on individual health data (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure, allergies).

- Medical Expert Consultation: Insights from medical professionals, including Dr. Assem, ensure that recommendations align with health guidelines.

- Advanced Machine Learning: Utilizes ML techniques and a memory-based system to track user preferences and provide increasingly accurate recommendations.

## Future Enhancements:

- User Accounts & Data Storage: Plan to allow users to save and track preferences, creating a more personalized experience over time.

- Real-Time Health Tracking: Future versions aim to integrate ongoing health data for dynamic recommendations.



## Dataset

Our dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes:

- Recipes: 522,517 recipes across 312 categories, detailing ingredients, cooking instructions, nutrition, and more.

- Reviews: 1,401,982 user reviews, providing insights on taste, quality, and recommendations from other users.


## Model Architecture

The model leverages a multi-layer recommendation system combining:

- Nutritional Filtering: Ensures recipes meet specific dietary restrictions.

- Collaborative Filtering: Recommends based on similar user preferences and health conditions.

- Content-Based Filtering: Matches recipes to user profiles based on ingredients and cooking styles.


# Getting Started

Prerequisites
